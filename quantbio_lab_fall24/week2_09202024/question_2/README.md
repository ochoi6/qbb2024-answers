## Step 2.3 Draw conclusions from plot

### Instructions: Based on the plotted data from step 2.2, you should be able to draw some conclusions. Put answers in the file README.md


### Questions : 

#### 1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 

ANSWER: Exons seem to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection because we can see a linear relationship where as MAF increases, enrichment decreases (a easy indicator being the general negative slope trend the line has). 


#### 2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 

ANSWER: For most of the features, they tend to start enriched at lower MAFs and then deplete as MAF increases probably due to evolutionary section. MAF refers to the frequency at which the second most common allele occurs in a given population for a particular genetic variant. So low MAFs are considered 'harmful' because they have a higher tendency to have a phenotypic effect on important functional genome parts. As MAF increases, the variants become 'less harmful' and they spread stoichastically, making them less enriched. 


#### 3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.

ANSWER: The non-coding features (cCREs, introns, and other) have a similar selective pressure that could be considered as "neutral", which makes sense because they are under much less selective pressure and have higher variation accumulation (as seen by the even horizontal slope even at higher MAF values). In contrast, exons are under stronger selective pressure because they are coding regions and they demonstrate this by having higher enrichment at lower MAFs, with this decreasing as MAF increases.
