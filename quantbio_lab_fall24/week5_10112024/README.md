#  WEEK 5 EXERCISE ANSWERS 

## Exercise 1 : Checking fastq quality 

### Step 1.1 - Open fastqc and load both sample files from the File menu 

#### Question : Do any stand out as problematic? Can you think of a reason why this sample does not match the expected GC content distribution and base content at the beginning of sequences?

#### Answer : In the fastqc report, the per base sequence content and per sequence GC content seem to stand out. It seems that these 2 things don't match the expected because the RNA-sequencing data for this is specifically from Drosophila midgut rather than from all tissue samples. 

### Step 1.2 - Overrepresented sequences 

#### Question : What is the origin of the most overrepresented sequence in this sample? Does it make sense?

#### Answer : The most overrepresented sequence has 27 counts and is from Drosophila. This makes sense because our sample was taken from Drosophila. 


## Exercise 2 : Using MultiQC to check processed data quality

#### Question : If you were to reject any samples with the percentage of unique reads less than 45%, how many samples would you keep?

#### Answer : I would keep 15 samples. 

#### Question : Can you see the blocks of triplicates clearly? Try adjusting the min slider up. Does this suggest anything about consistency between replicates?

#### Answer : The blocks of triplicates are clearly visible. There are a couple of samples in the slight middle left and right portion are slightly fainter, but overall it is distinct. This suggests that there is high consistency between the replicates. 

## Exercise 3 : Normalization and clustering

### Step 3.3 - PCA analysis 

#### Question : Examine the PCA plot. Does everything look okay (We wouldnâ€™t ask if it did)? What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?

#### Answer : LFC-Fe replicate 3 and Fe replicate 1 seem to be labeled incorrectly because they are clustered with the wrong groups. LFC-Fe replicate 3 is clustered together to Fe replicates 1,2 and Fe replicate 1 is clustered together to LFC-Fe replicates 2,3. 

### Step 3.6 - Gene ontology enrichment analysis

#### Question : Do the categories of enrichments make sense? Why?
