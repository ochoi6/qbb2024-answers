### Exercise 3: Score the PCNA and nascent RNA signal in each nucleus and plot them

#### Question 3.1 

What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled?

ANSWER: There are 4 values in this table: gene,  nascentRNA, PCNA, and ratio. The gene is for the 4 genes (APEX1, PIM2, POLR2B, and SRSF1) that were being knocked down by siRNA in this experimental design and data output being examined. The nascentRNA helps determine whether transcription is being actively done or not in the cell and the rate at which it is being done using a 'synthetic base-analogue 5-ethynyl uridine (EU)'. This base is fluorescent and helps perform live time tracking. PCNA (which stands for proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was measured to see which cells were replicating DNA (S-phase of cell cycle) using antibody staining. Finally, the ratio is calculated by dividng nascent RNA signal by PCNA and then taking the log2 of that value. This shows how much new RNA is being produced relative to DNA replication - so higher ratio value means higher transcription activation vs lower ratio means lower transcription activation. 


#### Question 3.2 

Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.

ANSWER: Highest ratio gene is APEX1 and lowest ratio gene is SRSF1. APEX1 (stands for Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endodeoxyribonuclease 1) is an important gene for DNA repair mechanism, specifically base excision repair for mutations caused by oxidative stress damage. It makes sense when this gene is knocked down there is more transcription levels because more damaged sites go un-repaired and in response to this, the cell undergoes higher levels of transcription encoding for other repair pathways/mechanisms to target this. Additionally, SRSF1 (stands for Serine and Arginine Rich Splicing Factor 1) and is a gene encoding for splicing factors involved in mRNA processing and alternative splicing regulation. It makes sense that knocking down SRSF1 gene leads to reduced transcriptional efficiency because mRNA cannot be properly spliced and processed.
